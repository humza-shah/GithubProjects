# Knight Hero!

In this game, the user moves around a knight and collects herbs around the map. Once the player collects all the blue herbs, they can deliver them to the wizard to win the game!
The user must also avoid enemies that chase him. If an enemy catches the user, they lose.
The user can also collect a bonus gold herb for more points but they should avoid black poisonous herbs that lower their points and will cause them to lose if they take too many.
Mountains will also be scattered in random locations across the map. The user can not pass through these mountains and must traverse around them.
