In this project, I setup a fun interface that creates a number of circles and a time duration (both specified by the user).
Each circle shrinks and grows one at a time based on the given time duration before eventually disappering.
Furthermore, the user can continuously create circles (parrallel processing) as much as they would like.

Additionally, I added a side project that is able to draw circles using the mouse by clicking at two different points.
The first click sets the center of the circle. Then the user can move the cursor to a different location.
The circle is "animated" as the user moves the cursor around and the circle gets set once the user clicks again.
The user can create as many circles as they would like until they close the program.
